  "Abstract base class for convolutional recurrent layers.

    Do not use in a model -- it's not a functional layer!

    # Arguments
        filters: Integer, the dimensionality of the output space
            (i.e. the number output of filters in the convolution).
        kernel_size: An integer or tuple/list of n integers, specifying the
            dimensions of the convolution window.
        strides: An integer or tuple/list of n integers,
            specifying the strides of the convolution.
            Specifying any stride value != 1 is incompatible with specifying
            any `dilation_rate` value != 1.
        padding: One of `\"valid\"` or `\"same\"` (case-insensitive).
        data_format: A string,
            one of `channels_last` (default) or `channels_first`.
            The ordering of the dimensions in the inputs.
            `channels_last` corresponds to inputs with shape
            `(batch, time, ..., channels)`
            while `channels_first` corresponds to
            inputs with shape `(batch, time, channels, ...)`.
            It defaults to the `image_data_format` value found in your
            Keras config file at `~/.keras/keras.json`.
            If you never set it, then it will be \"channels_last\".
        dilation_rate: An integer or tuple/list of n integers, specifying
            the dilation rate to use for dilated convolution.
            Currently, specifying any `dilation_rate` value != 1 is
            incompatible with specifying any `strides` value != 1.
        return_sequences: Boolean. Whether to return the last output
            in the output sequence, or the full sequence.
        go_backwards: Boolean (default False).
            If True, process the input sequence backwards.
        stateful: Boolean (default False). If True, the last state
            for each sample at index i in a batch will be used as initial
            state for the sample of index i in the following batch.

    # Input shape
        5D tensor with shape `(num_samples, timesteps, channels, rows, cols)`.

    # Output shape
        - if `return_sequences`: 5D tensor with shape
            `(num_samples, timesteps, channels, rows, cols)`.
        - else, 4D tensor with shape `(num_samples, channels, rows, cols)`.

    # Masking
        This layer supports masking for input data with a variable number
        of timesteps. To introduce masks to your data,
        use an [Embedding](embeddings.md) layer with the `mask_zero` parameter
        set to `True`.
        **Note:** for the time being, masking is only supported with Theano.

    # Note on using statefulness in RNNs
        You can set RNN layers to be 'stateful', which means that the states
        computed for the samples in one batch will be reused as initial states
        for the samples in the next batch.
        This assumes a one-to-one mapping between
        samples in different successive batches.

        To enable statefulness:
            - specify `stateful=True` in the layer constructor.
            - specify a fixed batch size for your model, by passing
                a `batch_input_size=(...)` to the first layer in your model.
                This is the expected shape of your inputs *including the batch
                size*.
                It should be a tuple of integers, e.g. `(32, 10, 100)`.

        To reset the states of your model, call `.reset_states()` on either
        a specific layer, or on your entire model.
