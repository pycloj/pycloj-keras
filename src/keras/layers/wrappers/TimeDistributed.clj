(ns keras.layers.wrappers.TimeDistributed
  "This wrapper applies a layer to every temporal slice of an input.

    The input should be at least 3D, and the dimension of index one
    will be considered to be the temporal dimension.

    Consider a batch of 32 samples,
    where each sample is a sequence of 10 vectors of 16 dimensions.
    The batch input shape of the layer is then `(32, 10, 16)`,
    and the `input_shape`, not including the samples dimension, is `(10, 16)`.

    You can then use `TimeDistributed` to apply a `Dense` layer
    to each of the 10 timesteps, independently:

    ```python
        # as the first layer in a model
        model = Sequential()
        model.add(TimeDistributed(Dense(8), input_shape=(10, 16)))
        # now model.output_shape == (None, 10, 8)
    ```

    The output will then have shape `(32, 10, 8)`.

    In subsequent layers, there is no need for the `input_shape`:

    ```python
        model.add(TimeDistributed(Dense(32)))
        # now model.output_shape == (None, 10, 32)
    ```

    The output will then have shape `(32, 10, 32)`.

    `TimeDistributed` can be used with arbitrary layers, not just `Dense`,
    for instance with a `Conv2D` layer:

    ```python
        model = Sequential()
        model.add(TimeDistributed(Conv2D(64, (3, 3)),
                                  input_shape=(10, 299, 299, 3)))
    ```

    # Arguments
        layer: a layer instance.
