  "Apply multiplicative 1-centered Gaussian noise.

    As it is a regularization layer, it is only active at training time.

    # Arguments
        rate: float, drop probability (as with `Dropout`).
            The multiplicative noise will have
            standard deviation `sqrt(rate / (1 - rate))`.

    # Input shape
        Arbitrary. Use the keyword argument `input_shape`
        (tuple of integers, does not include the samples axis)
        when using this layer as the first layer in a model.

    # Output shape
        Same shape as input.
