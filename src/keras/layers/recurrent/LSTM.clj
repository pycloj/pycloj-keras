  "Long Short-Term Memory layer - Hochreiter 1997.

    # Arguments
        units: Positive integer, dimensionality of the output space.
        activation: Activation function to use
            (see [activations](../activations.md)).
            Default: hyperbolic tangent (`tanh`).
            If you pass `None`, no activation is applied
            (ie. \"linear\" activation: `a(x) = x`).
        recurrent_activation: Activation function to use
            for the recurrent step
            (see [activations](../activations.md)).
            Default: hard sigmoid (`hard_sigmoid`).
            If you pass `None`, no activation is applied
            (ie. \"linear\" activation: `a(x) = x`).
        use_bias: Boolean, whether the layer uses a bias vector.
        kernel_initializer: Initializer for the `kernel` weights matrix,
            used for the linear transformation of the inputs.
            (see [initializers](../initializers.md)).
        recurrent_initializer: Initializer for the `recurrent_kernel`
            weights matrix,
            used for the linear transformation of the recurrent state.
            (see [initializers](../initializers.md)).
        bias_initializer: Initializer for the bias vector
            (see [initializers](../initializers.md)).
        unit_forget_bias: Boolean.
            If True, add 1 to the bias of the forget gate at initialization.
            Setting it to true will also force `bias_initializer=\"zeros\"`.
            This is recommended in [Jozefowicz et al.]
            (http://www.jmlr.org/proceedings/papers/v37/jozefowicz15.pdf).
        kernel_regularizer: Regularizer function applied to
            the `kernel` weights matrix
            (see [regularizer](../regularizers.md)).
        recurrent_regularizer: Regularizer function applied to
            the `recurrent_kernel` weights matrix
            (see [regularizer](../regularizers.md)).
        bias_regularizer: Regularizer function applied to the bias vector
            (see [regularizer](../regularizers.md)).
        activity_regularizer: Regularizer function applied to
            the output of the layer (its \"activation\").
            (see [regularizer](../regularizers.md)).
        kernel_constraint: Constraint function applied to
            the `kernel` weights matrix
            (see [constraints](../constraints.md)).
        recurrent_constraint: Constraint function applied to
            the `recurrent_kernel` weights matrix
            (see [constraints](../constraints.md)).
        bias_constraint: Constraint function applied to the bias vector
            (see [constraints](../constraints.md)).
        dropout: Float between 0 and 1.
            Fraction of the units to drop for
            the linear transformation of the inputs.
        recurrent_dropout: Float between 0 and 1.
            Fraction of the units to drop for
            the linear transformation of the recurrent state.
        implementation: Implementation mode, either 1 or 2.
            Mode 1 will structure its operations as a larger number of
            smaller dot products and additions, whereas mode 2 will
            batch them into fewer, larger operations. These modes will
            have different performance profiles on different hardware and
            for different applications.
        return_sequences: Boolean. Whether to return the last output
            in the output sequence, or the full sequence.
        return_state: Boolean. Whether to return the last state
            in addition to the output.
        go_backwards: Boolean (default False).
            If True, process the input sequence backwards and return the
            reversed sequence.
        stateful: Boolean (default False). If True, the last state
            for each sample at index i in a batch will be used as initial
            state for the sample of index i in the following batch.
        unroll: Boolean (default False).
            If True, the network will be unrolled,
            else a symbolic loop will be used.
            Unrolling can speed-up a RNN,
            although it tends to be more memory-intensive.
            Unrolling is only suitable for short sequences.
