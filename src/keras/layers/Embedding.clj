  "Turns positive integers (indexes) into dense vectors of fixed size.
    eg. [[4], [20]] -> [[0.25, 0.1], [0.6, -0.2]]

    This layer can only be used as the first layer in a model.

    # Example

    ```python
      model = Sequential()
      model.add(Embedding(1000, 64, input_length=10))
      # the model will take as input an integer matrix of size (batch, input_length).
      # the largest integer (i.e. word index) in the input should be
      # no larger than 999 (vocabulary size).
      # now model.output_shape == (None, 10, 64), where None is the batch dimension.

      input_array = np.random.randint(1000, size=(32, 10))

      model.compile('rmsprop', 'mse')
      output_array = model.predict(input_array)
      assert output_array.shape == (32, 10, 64)
    ```

    # Arguments
        input_dim: int > 0. Size of the vocabulary,
            i.e. maximum integer index + 1.
        output_dim: int >= 0. Dimension of the dense embedding.
        embeddings_initializer: Initializer for the `embeddings` matrix
            (see [initializers](../initializers.md)).
        embeddings_regularizer: Regularizer function applied to
            the `embeddings` matrix
            (see [regularizer](../regularizers.md)).
        activity_regularizer: Regularizer function applied to
            the output of the layer (its \"activation\").
            (see [regularizer](../regularizers.md)).
        embeddings_constraint: Constraint function applied to
            the `embeddings` matrix
            (see [constraints](../constraints.md)).
        mask_zero: Whether or not the input value 0 is a special \"padding\"
            value that should be masked out.
            This is useful when using [recurrent layers](recurrent.md)
            which may take variable length input.
            If this is `True` then all subsequent layers
            in the model need to support masking or an exception will be raised.
            If mask_zero is set to True, as a consequence, index 0 cannot be
            used in the vocabulary (input_dim should equal size of
            vocabulary + 1).
        input_length: Length of input sequences, when it is constant.
            This argument is required if you are going to connect
            `Flatten` then `Dense` layers upstream
            (without it, the shape of the dense outputs cannot be computed).

    # Input shape
        2D tensor with shape: `(batch_size, sequence_length)`.

    # Output shape
        3D tensor with shape: `(batch_size, sequence_length, output_dim)`.
