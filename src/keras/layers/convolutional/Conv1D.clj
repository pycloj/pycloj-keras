(ns keras.layers.convolutional.Conv1D
  "1D convolution layer (e.g. temporal convolution).

    This layer creates a convolution kernel that is convolved
    with the layer input over a single spatial (or temporal) dimension
    to produce a tensor of outputs.
    If `use_bias` is True, a bias vector is created and added to the outputs.
    Finally, if `activation` is not `None`,
    it is applied to the outputs as well.

    When using this layer as the first layer in a model,
    provide an `input_shape` argument (tuple of integers or `None`, does not
    include the batch axis), e.g. `input_shape=(10, 128)` for time series
    sequences of 10 time steps with 128 features per step in
    `data_format=\"channels_last\"`, or `(None, 128)` for variable-length
    sequences with 128 features per step.

    # Arguments
        filters: Integer, the dimensionality of the output space
            (i.e. the number of output filters in the convolution).
        kernel_size: An integer or tuple/list of a single integer,
            specifying the length of the 1D convolution window.
        strides: An integer or tuple/list of a single integer,
            specifying the stride length of the convolution.
            Specifying any stride value != 1 is incompatible with specifying
            any `dilation_rate` value != 1.
        padding: One of `\"valid\"`, `\"causal\"` or `\"same\"` (case-insensitive).
            `\"valid\"` means \"no padding\".
            `\"same\"` results in padding the input such that
            the output has the same length as the original input.
            `\"causal\"` results in causal (dilated) convolutions,
            e.g. `output[t]` does not depend on `input[t + 1:]`.
            A zero padding is used such that
            the output has the same length as the original input.
            Useful when modeling temporal data where the model
            should not violate the temporal order. See
            [WaveNet: A Generative Model for Raw Audio, section 2.1](
            https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.03499).

            while `\"channels_first\"` corresponds to inputs
            with shape `(batch, channels, steps)`.
        dilation_rate: an integer or tuple/list of a single integer, specifying
            the dilation rate to use for dilated convolution.
            Currently, specifying any `dilation_rate` value != 1 is
            incompatible with specifying any `strides` value != 1.
        activation: Activation function to use
            (see [activations](../activations.md)).
            If you don't specify anything, no activation is applied
            (ie. \"linear\" activation: `a(x) = x`).
        use_bias: Boolean, whether the layer uses a bias vector.
        kernel_initializer: Initializer for the `kernel` weights matrix
            (see [initializers](../initializers.md)).
