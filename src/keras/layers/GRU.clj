  "Gated Recurrent Unit - Cho et al. 2014.

    There are two variants. The default one is based on 1406.1078v3 and
    has reset gate applied to hidden state before matrix multiplication. The
    other one is based on original 1406.1078v1 and has the order reversed.

    The second variant is compatible with CuDNNGRU (GPU-only) and allows
    inference on CPU. Thus it has separate biases for `kernel` and
    `recurrent_kernel`. Use `'reset_after'=True` and
    `recurrent_activation='sigmoid'`.

    # Arguments
        units: Positive integer, dimensionality of the output space.
        activation: Activation function to use
            (see [activations](../activations.md)).
            Default: hyperbolic tangent (`tanh`).
            If you pass `None`, no activation is applied
            (ie. \"linear\" activation: `a(x) = x`).
        recurrent_activation: Activation function to use
            for the recurrent step
            (see [activations](../activations.md)).
            Default: hard sigmoid (`hard_sigmoid`).
            If you pass `None`, no activation is applied
            (ie. \"linear\" activation: `a(x) = x`).
        use_bias: Boolean, whether the layer uses a bias vector.
        kernel_initializer: Initializer for the `kernel` weights matrix,
            used for the linear transformation of the inputs
            (see [initializers](../initializers.md)).
        recurrent_initializer: Initializer for the `recurrent_kernel`
            weights matrix,
            used for the linear transformation of the recurrent state
            (see [initializers](../initializers.md)).
        bias_initializer: Initializer for the bias vector
            (see [initializers](../initializers.md)).
        kernel_regularizer: Regularizer function applied to
            the `kernel` weights matrix
            (see [regularizer](../regularizers.md)).
        recurrent_regularizer: Regularizer function applied to
            the `recurrent_kernel` weights matrix
            (see [regularizer](../regularizers.md)).
        bias_regularizer: Regularizer function applied to the bias vector
            (see [regularizer](../regularizers.md)).
        activity_regularizer: Regularizer function applied to
            the output of the layer (its \"activation\").
            (see [regularizer](../regularizers.md)).
        kernel_constraint: Constraint function applied to
            the `kernel` weights matrix
            (see [constraints](../constraints.md)).
        recurrent_constraint: Constraint function applied to
            the `recurrent_kernel` weights matrix
            (see [constraints](../constraints.md)).
        bias_constraint: Constraint function applied to the bias vector
            (see [constraints](../constraints.md)).
        dropout: Float between 0 and 1.
            Fraction of the units to drop for
            the linear transformation of the inputs.
        recurrent_dropout: Float between 0 and 1.
            Fraction of the units to drop for
            the linear transformation of the recurrent state.
        implementation: Implementation mode, either 1 or 2.
            Mode 1 will structure its operations as a larger number of
            smaller dot products and additions, whereas mode 2 will
            batch them into fewer, larger operations. These modes will
            have different performance profiles on different hardware and
            for different applications.
        return_sequences: Boolean. Whether to return the last output
            in the output sequence, or the full sequence.
        return_state: Boolean. Whether to return the last state
            in addition to the output.
        go_backwards: Boolean (default False).
            If True, process the input sequence backwards and return the
            reversed sequence.
        stateful: Boolean (default False). If True, the last state
            for each sample at index i in a batch will be used as initial
            state for the sample of index i in the following batch.
        unroll: Boolean (default False).
            If True, the network will be unrolled,
            else a symbolic loop will be used.
            Unrolling can speed-up a RNN,
            although it tends to be more memory-intensive.
            Unrolling is only suitable for short sequences.
        reset_after: GRU convention (whether to apply reset gate after or
            before matrix multiplication). False = \"before\" (default),
            True = \"after\" (CuDNN compatible).
