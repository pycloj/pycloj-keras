  "Base class for convolutional-recurrent layers.

    # Arguments
        cell: A RNN cell instance. A RNN cell is a class that has:
            - a `call(input_at_t, states_at_t)` method, returning
              `(output_at_t, states_at_t_plus_1)`. The call method of the
              cell can also take the optional argument `constants`, see
              section \"Note on passing external constants\" below.
            - a `state_size` attribute. This can be a single integer (single state)
              in which case it is the number of channels of the recurrent state
              (which should be the same as the number of channels of the cell
              output). This can also be a list/tuple of integers
              (one size per state). In this case, the first entry (`state_size[0]`)
              should be the same as the size of the cell output.
        return_sequences: Boolean. Whether to return the last output.
            in the output sequence, or the full sequence.
        return_state: Boolean. Whether to return the last state
            in addition to the output.
        go_backwards: Boolean (default False).
            If True, process the input sequence backwards and return the
            reversed sequence.
        stateful: Boolean (default False). If True, the last state
            for each sample at index i in a batch will be used as initial
            state for the sample of index i in the following batch.
        input_shape: Use this argument to specify the shape of the
            input when this layer is the first one in a model.

    # Input shape
        5D tensor with shape:
        `(samples, timesteps, channels, rows, cols)` if data_format='channels_first'
        or 5D tensor with shape:
        `(samples, timesteps, rows, cols, channels)` if data_format='channels_last'.

    # Output shape
        - if `return_state`: a list of tensors. The first tensor is
            the output. The remaining tensors are the last states,
            each 5D tensor with shape:
            `(samples, timesteps,
              filters, new_rows, new_cols)` if data_format='channels_first'
            or 5D tensor with shape:
            `(samples, timesteps,
              new_rows, new_cols, filters)` if data_format='channels_last'.
            `rows` and `cols` values might have changed due to padding.
        - if `return_sequences`: 5D tensor with shape:
            `(samples, timesteps,
              filters, new_rows, new_cols)` if data_format='channels_first'
            or 5D tensor with shape:
            `(samples, timesteps,
              new_rows, new_cols, filters)` if data_format='channels_last'.
        - else, 4D tensor with shape:
            `(samples, filters, new_rows, new_cols)` if data_format='channels_first'
            or 4D tensor with shape:
            `(samples, new_rows, new_cols, filters)` if data_format='channels_last'.

    # Masking
        This layer supports masking for input data with a variable number
        of timesteps. To introduce masks to your data,
        use an [Embedding](embeddings.md) layer with the `mask_zero` parameter
        set to `True`.

    # Note on using statefulness in RNNs
        You can set RNN layers to be 'stateful', which means that the states
        computed for the samples in one batch will be reused as initial states
        for the samples in the next batch. This assumes a one-to-one mapping
        between samples in different successive batches.

        To enable statefulness:
            - specify `stateful=True` in the layer constructor.
            - specify a fixed batch size for your model, by passing
                 - if sequential model:
                    `batch_input_shape=(...)` to the first layer in your model.
                 - if functional model with 1 or more Input layers:
                    `batch_shape=(...)` to all the first layers in your model.
                    This is the expected shape of your inputs
                    *including the batch size*.
                    It should be a tuple of integers, e.g. `(32, 10, 100, 100, 32)`.
                    Note that the number of rows and columns should be specified too.
            - specify `shuffle=False` when calling fit().

        To reset the states of your model, call `.reset_states()` on either
        a specific layer, or on your entire model.

    # Note on specifying the initial state of RNNs
        You can specify the initial state of RNN layers symbolically by
        calling them with the keyword argument `initial_state`. The value of
        `initial_state` should be a tensor or list of tensors representing
        the initial state of the RNN layer.

        You can specify the initial state of RNN layers numerically by
        calling `reset_states` with the keyword argument `states`. The value of
        `states` should be a numpy array or list of numpy arrays representing
        the initial state of the RNN layer.

    # Note on passing external constants to RNNs
        You can pass \"external\" constants to the cell using the `constants`
        keyword argument of `RNN.__call__` (as well as `RNN.call`) method. This
        requires that the `cell.call` method accepts the same keyword argument
        `constants`. Such constants can be used to condition the cell
        transformation on additional static inputs (not changing over time),
        a.k.a. an attention mechanism.
