(ns keras.initializers.TruncatedNormal
  "Initializer that generates a truncated normal distribution.

    These values are similar to values from a `RandomNormal`
    except that values more than two standard deviations from the mean
    are discarded and re-drawn. This is the recommended initializer for
    neural network weights and filters.

    # Arguments
        mean: a python scalar or a scalar tensor. Mean of the random values
          to generate.
        stddev: a python scalar or a scalar tensor. Standard deviation of the
          random values to generate.
        seed: A Python integer. Used to seed the random generator.
