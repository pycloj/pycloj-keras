  "Callback used to stream events to a server.

    Requires the `requests` library.
    Events are sent to `root + '/publish/epoch/end/'` by default. Calls are
    HTTP POST, with a `data` argument which is a
    JSON-encoded dictionary of event data.
    If send_as_json is set to True, the content type of the request will be
    application/json. Otherwise the serialized JSON will be send within a form

    # Arguments
        root: String; root url of the target server.
        path: String; path relative to `root` to which the events will be sent.
        field: String; JSON field under which the data will be stored.
            The field is used only if the payload is sent within a form
            (i.e. send_as_json is set to False).
        headers: Dictionary; optional custom HTTP headers.
        send_as_json: Boolean; whether the request should be send as
            application/json.
