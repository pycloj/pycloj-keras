(defn get-file 
  "Downloads a file from a URL if it not already in the cache.

    By default the file at the url `origin` is downloaded to the
    cache_dir `~/.keras`, placed in the cache_subdir `datasets`,
    and given the filename `fname`. The final location of a file
    `example.txt` would therefore be `~/.keras/datasets/example.txt`.

    Files in tar, tar.gz, tar.bz, and zip formats can also be extracted.
    Passing a hash will verify the file after download. The command line
    programs `shasum` and `sha256sum` can compute the hash.

    # Arguments
        fname: Name of the file. If an absolute path `/path/to/file.txt` is
            specified the file will be saved at that location.
        origin: Original URL of the file.
        untar: Deprecated in favor of 'extract'.
            boolean, whether the file should be decompressed
        md5_hash: Deprecated in favor of 'file_hash'.
            md5 hash of the file for verification
        file_hash: The expected hash string of the file after download.
            The sha256 and md5 hash algorithms are both supported.
        cache_subdir: Subdirectory under the Keras cache dir where the file is
            saved. If an absolute path `/path/to/folder` is
            specified the file will be saved at that location.
        hash_algorithm: Select the hash algorithm to verify the file.
            options are 'md5', 'sha256', and 'auto'.
            The default 'auto' detects the hash algorithm in use.
        extract: True tries extracting the file as an Archive, like tar or zip.
        archive_format: Archive format to try for extracting the file.
            Options are 'auto', 'tar', 'zip', and None.
            'tar' includes tar, tar.gz, and tar.bz files.
            The default 'auto' is ['tar', 'zip'].
            None or an empty list will return no matches found.
        cache_dir: Location to store cached files, when None it
            defaults to the [Keras Directory](/faq/#where-is-the-keras-configuration-filed-stored).

        Path to the downloaded file
